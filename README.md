# Real-Time-Implementation-of-All-Basic-Logic-Gates
Real-time implementation of all basic logic gates (NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) using Arduino Nano. Inputs are provided via pushbuttons, gate selection via a potentiometer, and output is displayed through an LED and SSD1306 OLED display. Fully functional and tested as an educational digital logic tool.
